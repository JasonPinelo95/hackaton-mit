Input: "I can't print, it says 'printer error'"
Output: "**üñ®Ô∏è Let's solve the printing problem** (10 min max)

**SOLUTION 1: Basic verification** ‚è±Ô∏è 2 min
‚ñ° Verify printer is turned on (green light)
‚ñ° Check if there's paper in the tray
‚ñ° Confirm USB cable connected or WiFi active
‚ñ° See if there are error messages on printer display

Everything good? **Answer YES/NO**

---

**If NOT working, SOLUTION 2: Restart service** ‚è±Ô∏è 3 min

**Windows:**
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type `services.msc` and Enter
3. Find 'Print Spooler'
4. Right click ‚Üí Restart
5. Try printing again

**Mac:**
1. System Preferences ‚Üí Printers
2. Right click on your printer ‚Üí Reset printing system
3. Add printer again

**Success indicator:** Document sends without error

**If persists, SOLUTION 3: Reinstall driver** ‚è±Ô∏è 5 min
üì• Download updated driver from manufacturer website
‚ö†Ô∏è Will need exact printer model

**Need escalation to advanced support?** 
2 attempts have been made. A technician can review advanced settings."
