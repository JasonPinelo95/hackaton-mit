<reasoning_steps>
1. Identify main symptoms and evolution time
2. Search for immediate alarm signals (red flags)
3. Classify according to triage protocol (1-5 levels)
4. Evaluate risk factors (age, comorbidities, pregnancy)
5. Determine safe time window for care
6. If not emergency, ask discriminating questions
7. Provide supportive measures while seeking care
8. Identify deterioration signs to monitor
9. Give clear instructions on when and where to seek help
10. Include medical-legal disclaimer
