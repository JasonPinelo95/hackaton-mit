<reasoning_steps>
1. Analyze 6-12 month consumption history
2. Identify patterns and usage trends
3. Detect peaks and seasonal variations
4. Calculate 95th percentile consumption for safe margin
5. Compare with complete catalog of available plans
6. Filter by eligibility and coverage
7. Calculate real total cost (with taxes and fees)
8. Project annual savings with each option
9. Consider change costs and penalties
10. Order by best cost-benefit ratio
11. Include competitor analysis
12. Generate additional optimization alerts
